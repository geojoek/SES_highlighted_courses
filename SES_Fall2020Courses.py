# Script for reading in excel spreadsheet of Highlighted Fall Courses for U-Mas SES website and dumping content out into formatted HTML file
# by Joe Kopera, April 2020

# *** Note: this presumes the Excel sheet is already sorted by department and course number.  Didn't have time to write subsection of script to sort sheet once read-in and then write out to new excel file as openpyxl doesn't sort natively.
# Could load openpyxl data into dictionary, sort it, and do it that way, but under a deadline and have EBV brain fog.

# As it stands this script just appends to the HTML file... it does not overwrite it.  I need to add that functionality.

workingFolder = r"[FOLDERPATH]" # Where the excel file is stored
excelFile = r"[FILEPATH]" # The name of the excel  file
outFileName = r"[OUTFILEPATH]" # The name of the HTML file to write out to

# Department equivalents based on field contents in spreadsheet that we already know are there:

titleBCT = "Building and Construction Technology"
titleECO = "Environmental Conservation"
titleENVIRSCI = "Environmental Science"
titleGeograph = "Geography"
titleGeol = "Geology"
titleGeosci = "Geosciences"
titleLANDARCH = "Landscape Architecture"
titleMicrobio = "Microbiology"
titleNRC = "Natural Resources Conservation"
titleREGIONPL = "Regonal Planning"
titleSTOCKSCH = "Stockbridge School of Agriculture"
titleSUSTCOMM = "Sustainable Communities"
